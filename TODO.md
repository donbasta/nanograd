# TODO

## Todolist

- [ ] benerin makefilenya biar ga cluttered
- [ ] implement optimizers and loss functions
  - [ ] binary crossentropy (for binary classifier)
- [ ] visualize training process and accuracy
- [ ] rapiin typing, classes, subclassing, etc (the oop and rpl stuff lah pokonye)
  - [ ] create abstract class Layer
  - [ ] create abstract class Model
  - [ ] create type for data
- [ ] allow model to read weights from external file
- [ ] give proper documentation to the code
- [ ] structure the code yg baik dan benar lol (unit test, etc)
- [ ] kaidah cpp programming yg baik dan benar (not using bits/stdc++.h, not using namespace std lgsg)
- [ ] create unit tests and drivers for each unit
- [ ] use numcpp [here](https://dpilger26.github.io/NumCpp/doxygen/html/index.html) for the values and models...
  - [ ] check whether the matrix multiplication is optimized there

## Cool to have (probably impossible and not worth trying, memory issue is hard)

- [ ] implement convolutional layer and simple convnet based model
- [ ] train mnist digit
- [ ] implement recurrent layer and RNN, LSTM, GRU
- [ ] train tweet sentiment
- [ ] implement attention layer and transformer, and GPT maybe
- [ ] simple text generator using transformer

## Notes:

- [ ] using large value of data will cause gradient explode lol c++ so lame (i.e nan values here), so implement clipping as well (duh) or normalize weights (batchnorm, perhaps?)
